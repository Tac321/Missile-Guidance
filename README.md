## Missile-Guidance
Targeting of maneuvering targets using a four fin missile configuration.

## Simulation Test Cases
This simulation of a guided projectile was ran for impact angle designation targeting and tracking of a moving target under sinusoidal oscillation in the inertial frame x-axis and y-axis.  Proportional Navigation (PNG) was used for the missile tracking algorithms, and this model includes a 3-Loop autopilot model. This model can target static and moving targets.
